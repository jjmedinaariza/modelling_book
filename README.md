# modelling_book

This repository contains the materials used for the textbook we use for teaching R as part of our undergraduate module "Modelling Criminological Data" for 2nd year criminology students at the University of Manchester. It follows from our more introductory material that is covered in "Making Sense of Criminological Data", where we start students into data analysis ideas and concepts using Excel. The materials from "Making Sense..." are available here: https://maczokni.github.io/MSCD/
